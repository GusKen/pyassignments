Ken Gustafson - Contributions to Problem Set 8
Learned various aspects of git version control with this assignment.

1) Used fedora 10. Setup a repository at GitHub and at codaset. 
In the end used GitHub. Got nowhere with fedora. Could not communicate 
with GitHub. 
2) Got sidetracked with svn. Made sure that I could communicate 
with the repositories that I had from previous work. Fine!
3) Looked at GUIs for svn namely rabbitvcs. Got partway there. Have to upgrade
the Fedora 10 python (which is 2.5) for pygobject, a required package. 
So leave that for another day!
4) Located a website for fedora 10 git repositories and gitosis,
http://www.webtop.com.au/blog/installing-git..., which discussed
the configuration issues in detail. This site clarified setting up 
repositories on the local machine but did not go into git websites.
5) Went to my winxp laptop. Set up the empty repository at GitHub.
Followed through with their proceedure with a local directory pyassignments
Everything worked except for commit -m 'first commit'. So just did commit.
It asked for a message in a word processor. Put one in and everything worked
just fine. However I noticed messages did not show up. 

6) To clone the site:

a) Create a directory for cloning ( I used Assignments)
b) do
git clone git@github.com:GusKen/pyassignments.git

c) It will ask for your rsa.pub paraphase ( I believe only yours since this 
is a public site)
